This repository contains a collection of projects worked on through the course of the semester in my computational physics class.

Vowel Classifier is a project that uses deep learning to create a model that is capable of detecting what vowel a person says.

The unit 2 project creates a function to calculate the Thrust of a rocket at any given time step through curve fitting the data given. 
Then will use derivatives and ODE solvers to model the rocket's thrust.

The unit 3 project creates a model of a Poincare Map for a Damped Driven Pendulum with a given value of gamma. As the physics of the 
pendulum change the Poincare Map should also be updated as well.
